# Method-For-SHREC-2021-Surface-based-Protein-Domains-Retrieval-APPFD-FK-GMM-
3D Shape Retrieval method (algorithm) called the Agglomeration of Augmented Point-pair Features Descriptor with Fisher Kernel and Gaussian Mixture Model (APPFD-FK-GMM). This method is applied for retrieval of 3D protein conformers, for the SHape REtrieval Contests (SHREC 2021) research tasks/challenges.
